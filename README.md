# Milestone
This is our chosen project for milestone of ELEC9607 in 2018 S1. The game is trying to get as deeper as you can. Hope you can get the higher score.

This game used Arduino due, a LCD(Nokia 5110), a 3d-accelerometer(MPU6050), and a bluetooth(HC05).

Code will be provided and we will be happy if it can help you.
Actually the code is little messy and clumsy. orz...
